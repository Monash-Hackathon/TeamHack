# Dream Job
Dream Job is a mobile web app that allows user to find out their career pathway, and also to search for jobs.

# Description
Dream Job has 2 main functions - performing a personality test and job searching. 

A RIASEC Personality Test was carried out to find out the user's personality. Based on the results from the personality test, the app would recommend career pathways to the user. The list of recommended pathways is stored in a hard-coded dictionary which can be searched upon.

The job searching functionality was carried out by 2 APIs, Adzuna API and Open Cage Geocoding API. Adzuna API is used to carry out the job searching, whereas Open Cage Geocoding API is used to locate the location's country.

The major drawback of this app is that a lot of the code was hard-code. We were unable to find any APIs that were free to perform a personality test, so the only other way was to hard-code all of the questions into the app as well as the results into the app. 

The second drawback of this app is that the Adzuna API only works in certain countries. We were unable to perform an error checking to show to the user if an error occured. 

# Installation
Dream Job does not need to be installed since it is a mobile web application, and can support devices on different platforms. All you need to have a web browser to open the HTML files to run the program.
